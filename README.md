# Cyber_Internship_Task_5
 Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

Name: PATEL SUDIP ALPESHKUMAR

From this Wireshark activity, I learned how to capture and analyze real network traffic. I saw how different protocols—like DNS, TCP, and ICMP—work in practice and how they appear in packet form. I learned how DNS resolves domain names, how TCP creates reliable connections using the handshake process, and how ICMP is used for ping and diagnostics. Overall, the lab helped me understand how network communication happens behind the scenes and gave me hands-on experience using Wireshark to inspect and interpret packets.
